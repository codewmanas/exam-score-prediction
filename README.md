# Exam Score Prediction Model

## 📚 About The Project
This project is part of my data science learning journey where I built a machine learning model to predict student exam scores. The model takes into account various factors that might influence academic performance and provides score predictions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python Libraries**
  - NumPy: For numerical computations and array operations
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
  - Seaborn: For statistical data visualization
  - Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
  - Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms
- **Frontend**
  - Streamlit: For creating the web application interface

## 🔍 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Interactive web interface for predictions

## 🚀 Getting Started
